My project Idea is to create a web app for exploring different movies using search button.
For that I structured my idea into creating a Html file first and then added few styles for the page.
Now adding a js file first to fetch the api and applying the api key here.
Added async function and export it into another js
Created new js file for movie display.Used forEach loop and created a div element and added html elements in the js and append it to card.
Created one more js file and import both functions here from script.js and display.js. 
Made lots of mistakes and changes again. Tried to come up with the result.
When giving a movie name  inside the text area and on click of search button gives an output  of movies with the year.
Added the setInterval
